# Calendar

## Calendar Information
Using third party material as a person with a busy schedule, I have created a functional calendar which has the ability to add important events to a daily planner I can manage my time effectively. When I open the planner then the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar. When I scroll down then I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours. When I view the time blocks for that day then each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future. When I click into a time block then I can enter an event. When I click the save button for that time block then the text for that event is saved in local storage. When I refresh the page then the events I have created have been saved and are easily accessed when the page loads up.
